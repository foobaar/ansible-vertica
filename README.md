# ansible-vertica
Vertica role for Ubuntu.
Based on https://github.com/semberal/vertica-vagrant

It's expected that:
- /dev/sda is the Vertica system's drive;
- Vertica version is 9.0+;
- vertica deb file is placed in the role's file directory.
Otherwise these parameters must be changed.

The playbook was tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
